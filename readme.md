# Open Archival Information System

This project consisted in the development of an **web application** for a file sharing platform that, briefly put, allows users to upload resources (one of more files of any type), making them available for others to see and download, in a similar fashion to **Dropbox**. The website also incorporates a system of notifications over said resources, allowing for a timeline of the most recent changes (uploading or editing), as well as publications, which users can post and comment on in order to share their opinion regarding a specific resource and discuss it with others.

The final solution uses a tripartite architecture, with an application server, an API server and an authentication server, developed with **Node.JS**, **Express**, **W3.CSS** and **PUG**, as well as **Bootstrap** and **Mongo Compass**.

The assignment was developed in **Development of Web Applications**, an optional subject of the Master's Degree (2020/21).
